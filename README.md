# 💫 About Me:
Hello World! I'm Omar Rizk, an aspiring Embedded Software Developer and Tester based in Egypt, passionate about embedded systems and automotive technologies.

With a knowledge in C, Modern C++, and Python, I am gaining experience with automotive tools like Vector CANoe, CANalyzer, and CAPL scripting. I have worked with automotive protocols such as CAN and LIN and have a growing understanding of ARM architecture. My knowledge also includes industry standards like AUTOSAR, ASPICE, and MISRA C.

Certified in ISTQB FL v4.0 and Agile Testing, I’m building hands-on experience in embedded unit testing, integration, validation, and system testing using tools like CUnit and GTest.

Follow along as I continue to learn and grow in the automotive world! 😊
